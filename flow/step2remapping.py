"""Remapping is the process of changing the image geometry in order to fit to the adjacent images that should contribute to a panorama. 
This remapping process "warps" the images in such a way so that they can be aligned perfectly. 
Without this remapping process, the images will not join together correctly. 
It includes conversion of camera image to sphere, Image alignment, setting screen projection.
